# Markdown

A customizable, 0 dependency markdown compiler written in C

This implementation isn't following a specification in particular, rather it's a mix of useful features I like. For now it has:

- Paragraphs
- Headings
- Links
- Unordered lists
- Asides
- Code blocks (no syntax highlight though)

## Customization

You may customize some features of the compiler through the `config.h` file, check out the [sample config file](./config.def.h) I've provided.
